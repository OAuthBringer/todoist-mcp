# Task-Section Integration Validation Results

Date: 2025-05-26
Status: **PASSED**

## Test Results

All 15 tests for task-section integration passed:
- 7 task-section integration tests ✓
- 8 move task tests ✓

## Validated Functionality

✓ `move_task` correctly passes section_id parameter
✓ `get_tasks` filters by section_id
✓ `get_tasks` returns section_id in task responses
✓ `get_task` includes section_id in single task response
✓ `add_task` accepts section_id parameter
✓ `update_task` preserves section_id in responses
✓ Tasks can be moved to/from sections (including section_id=None)

## Integration Points

The task-section integration is fully functional across:
- Task creation with sections
- Task movement between sections
- Task filtering by section
- Section preservation during updates

No issues found during validation.
