# Batch Operations Validation Report

## Overview
This document validates the implementation of batch operations for TodoistMCP v0.4.0.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Batch Move Tasks (`batch_move_tasks`)
- Moves multiple tasks to a different project or section
- Maximum 100 tasks per batch
- Returns `moved` and `failed` lists

### 2. Batch Update Labels (`batch_update_labels`)
- Add or remove labels from multiple tasks
- Preserves existing labels when adding
- Maximum 100 tasks per batch

### 3. Batch Update Tasks (`batch_update_tasks`)
- Update multiple tasks with the same properties
- Supports all task fields (priority, due dates, assignee, etc.)
- Maximum 100 tasks per batch

### 4. Batch Complete Tasks (`batch_complete_tasks`)
- Complete multiple tasks at once
- Handles already-completed and missing tasks gracefully
- Maximum 100 tasks per batch

## Test Results

### Unit Tests
- **Total**: 16 tests
- **Passed**: 16 ✓
- **Failed**: 0

### Test Coverage
1. Tool registration tests ✓
2. Basic functionality tests ✓
3. Error handling tests ✓
4. Edge cases (empty lists, max limits) ✓
5. Partial failure scenarios ✓

### Full Test Suite
```
Total tests: 120
Passed: 118
Failed: 1 (unrelated to batch operations)
Skipped: 1
```

## API Design

All batch operations follow consistent patterns:
- Accept `task_ids` list as primary parameter
- Return dictionary with success/failure lists
- Validate input (non-empty, max 100 items)
- Handle individual task failures gracefully

## Error Handling

1. **Empty task list**: Raises `ValueError`
2. **Exceeds 100 tasks**: Raises `ValueError`
3. **Individual failures**: Captured in `failed` list with error details
4. **Missing parameters**: Appropriate validation errors

## Performance Considerations

Current implementation processes tasks sequentially. For production use with large batches, consider:
- Concurrent processing with rate limiting
- Batch API endpoints if Todoist adds them
- Progress callbacks for long operations

## Conclusion

All batch operations are fully implemented and tested. The feature provides a robust foundation for bulk task management while maintaining consistency with existing TodoistMCP patterns.
